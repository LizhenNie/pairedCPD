# pairedCPD
This repository contains code to implement the proposed residual-based and two-sided estimators, and the two naive baselines.

It contains three files:
1. abruptCPD.R: function which will be called for the two baselines
2. conditionalExpectation.R: R function implementing the methods for conditional expectation changes
3. conditionalDistribution.R: R function implementing the methods for conditional distribution changes
